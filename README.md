# FIOT Assignment
This is our Fundamentals of IOT programming project that was done as our Y2 S2 elective.   

Within this assignment, we programmed the arduino board to communicate with cloud (thingspeak) and programmed
an app using app inventor.   

Furthermore as something extra, we created a Flask web server using Python to mimic the application in a web browser.
